Moto:
1) To structure and analyze the JSON data.

About the Files:
1) "Key5.json" is the final output file which shows the path, datatype, nullable and example of the end data as there might be nested list of dictiories inside the example_data.json .
2) In KEY_23 file the all the first level list of dictionaries are converted to only nested dctionaries with unique values and list from structured_data_example.json.
3) There are still a few ambiguities,in KEY_23 file but it's easy to identify the fields and their structure.
4) structured_data_example is the JSON file containing the structured data.
5)  Additionally, final_main is the code that was used to find the unique fields in the nested list of dictionaries.

Conclusion:
We have finally created an output which might be helpful for future purpose purpose.
